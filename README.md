Creating a post with pagination 

This is a practice for pagination in react. The contents content dummy data from jsonplaceholder.com. 
Using react hooks and axios we can create get requests to get our data from the api. 
The using custom html and css, we can display the data in boxes for each post.
As we get to the bottom of the page, we make a request to the server to pull more data before we reach the end.
